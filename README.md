# RuneScape Hiscores
Just a small interface I've been working on in my free time to display the stats of users of the MMORPG RuneScape

## What You Will Need
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)


## How To Use
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:/SalTor/runescape-hiscores.git
$ cd runescape-hiscores
$ npm install
$ grunt runescape &
$ npm start

Go to http://localhost:3000
```

### When You Want To Stop
```bash
$ ctrl + c
$ sudo killall grunt
```

## Moving Forward
- Username checks to see if they're of valid form
- Better front-end implementation, I've been looking into using Angular
- Possibly a better workflow, this is just what works for me


## Disclaimer
- I do not claim to own any information related to RuneScape
- This is just a side project I embarked on to see if I could do it
- I've been wanting to start using ES6 more, so if you want to contribute, please write your code in ES6 when possible
