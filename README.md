# OSRS (Old School RuneScape) Hiscores
Just a small interface I've been working on in my free time to display the stats of users for the legacy version of the MMORPG RuneScape--as it was in 2007.

## What You Will Need
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)


## How To Use
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:/SalTor/runescape-hiscores.git
$ cd runescape-hiscores
$ npm start
$
You will be directed to a localhost session with the contents of index.html
```


## Live Example
You can find this app running live [here](http://projects.saltor.nyc/RuneScape-HiScores).


## Moving Forward
- [ ] Separate out server from this repo
- [ ] A better workflow, this is just what works for me
- [X] ~~Better front-end implementation, I've been looking into using Angular~~


## Disclaimer
- I do not claim to own any information related to RuneScape.
  - This includes info. in the hiscores response as well as info. not included in the original hiscores response.
- At the end of the day, this is just a side project I embarked on for fun out of curiosity.
