# OSRS (Old School RuneScape) Hiscores
Just a small interface I've been working on in my free time to display the stats of users of the legacy MMORPG RuneScape. (The version of the game initially based on the 2007 version of the game.)

## What You Will Need
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [sass](http://sass-lang.com/install)


## How To Use
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:/SalTor/runescape-hiscores.git
$ cd runescape-hiscores
$ npm start
$
You will be redirected to http://localhost:some-available-port
depending on which ports are available
```


## Live Example
You can find this app running live [here](http://projects.saltor.nyc/RuneScape-HiScores).


## Moving Forward
- [ ] Separate out server from this repo
- [ ] A better workflow, this is just what works for me
- [X] ~~Better front-end implementation, I've been looking into using Angular~~


## Disclaimer
- I do not claim to own any information related to RuneScape.
  - That includes any information that is returned from submitting this hiscores form as well as the information that is transformed from said returned info into states that the original payload didn't include.
- At the end of the day, this is just a side project I embarked on for fun and out of curiosity.
