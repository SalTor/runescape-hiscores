# OSRS (Old School RuneScape) Hiscores
This is small interface I've been working on in my free time to display the stats of users for the legacy version of the MMORPG RuneScape; a version of the game as it was in 2007.

## How To Use
```bash
# Get started working locally
$ npm start
```

## Live Example
You can find this app running live [here](http://projects.saltor.nyc/RuneScape-HiScores).
